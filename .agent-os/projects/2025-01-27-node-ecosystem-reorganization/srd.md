# Node Ecosystem Reorganization - SRD

## Feature Overview

Reorganize the Papi Core node structure to improve discoverability, usability, and maintainability by following n8n's proven patterns for node organization and categorization.

## Goals

1. **Improve Discoverability**: Make it easy for developers to find and use the right nodes
2. **Enhance Organization**: Group related nodes logically by function and service provider
3. **Follow Industry Standards**: Adopt n8n's successful node organization patterns
4. **Enable Scalability**: Create a structure that supports future node additions
5. **Improve Developer Experience**: Make node usage more intuitive and well-documented

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to easily find AI-related nodes in a dedicated section
- I want to discover integration nodes grouped by service provider (Google, Slack, etc.)
- I want clear documentation and examples for each node type
- I want consistent node interfaces and configuration patterns
- I want to understand node capabilities through metadata

### As a System Administrator
- I want to understand which integrations require external API keys
- I want to see node dependencies and requirements
- I want to configure nodes consistently across the system
- I want to monitor node usage and performance

### As a Workflow Designer
- I want to browse nodes by category (AI, Integration, Utility)
- I want to see node input/output schemas
- I want to understand node configuration options
- I want to find similar nodes for different services

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ **Unified Node Structure**: All nodes organized under `/src/Nodes/`
- ✅ **AI Section**: AIAgent, LLM, Memory, Trigger nodes grouped together
- ✅ **Integration Categories**: Nodes organized by service provider
- ✅ **Node Metadata**: Each node has documentation and schema information
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ **Clear Organization**: Intuitive directory structure
- ✅ **Consistent Interfaces**: Standardized node patterns
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each node type documented
- ✅ **Easy Discovery**: Nodes can be found and understood quickly

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ **Namespace Consistency**: Proper PHP namespace organization
- ✅ **Autoloading**: Composer autoloader works correctly
- ✅ **Testing Coverage**: All nodes have proper test coverage
- ✅ **Performance**: No performance degradation from reorganization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Node Structure Reorganization
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/` as the main node directory
- [ ] Move AI-related nodes to `/src/Nodes/AI/`
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/` for service integrations
- [ ] Organize integration nodes by service provider
- [ ] Update all namespace declarations
- [ ] Update composer autoloader configuration

### AI Node Section
- [ ] Move AIAgent to `/src/Nodes/AI/AIAgent.php`
- [ ] Move LLMNode to `/src/Nodes/AI/LLM.php`
- [ ] Move MemoryInterface and InMemoryMemory to `/src/Nodes/AI/Memory/`
- [ ] Move TriggerInterface and trigger nodes to `/src/Nodes/AI/Trigger/`
- [ ] Update all imports and references

### Integration Node Organization
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/Google/` for Google services
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/Slack/` for Slack services
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/Database/` for database nodes
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/FileSystem/` for file operations
- [ ] Create `/src/Nodes/Integration/Communication/` for messaging

### Node Metadata System
- [ ] Define node metadata interface
- [ ] Add metadata to all existing nodes
- [ ] Create node discovery/registry system
- [ ] Add node documentation generation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Node discovery and loading should be fast (< 100ms)
- No impact on workflow execution performance
- Memory usage should remain efficient

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent coding patterns
- Easy to add new nodes
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Usability
- Intuitive directory structure
- Clear node categorization
- Easy to find and use nodes
- Good documentation and examples

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must work with existing composer autoloader
- Must not break existing tests
- Must follow PHP PSR standards

### Business Constraints
- Limited development time for reorganization
- Must not impact current development velocity
- Must support future node additions
- Must be maintainable by the team

## Risks

### Technical Risks
- **Namespace Conflicts**: Risk of namespace conflicts during reorganization
- **Breaking Changes**: Risk of accidentally breaking existing functionality
- **Performance Impact**: Risk of performance degradation from new structure

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Migration**: Move nodes one section at a time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test thoroughly after each change
- **Backup Strategy**: Keep original structure until migration is complete
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert changes if issues arise

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing node implementations
- Current test suite
- Composer autoloader configuration
- Documentation system

### External Dependencies
- PHP autoloading standards
- Composer package management
- Testing framework (PHPUnit)

## Assumptions

1. **n8n Pattern Success**: n8n's node organization pattern is proven and effective
2. **Developer Familiarity**: Developers will find the new structure intuitive
3. **Future Scalability**: The new structure will support future node additions
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code can be updated without major refactoring

## Out of Scope

- Creating new node implementations (focus on reorganization)
- Changing node interfaces or APIs
- Adding new integration services
- Creating UI components for node discovery
- Performance optimizations beyond basic requirements
