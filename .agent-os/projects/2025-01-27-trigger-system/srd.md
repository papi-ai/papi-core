# Trigger System - Spec Requirements Document

## Feature Overview

The Trigger System enables event-driven workflow execution by providing nodes that can initiate workflows from external events. Trigger nodes serve as entry points to workflows and can be configured to listen to various types of triggers.

## Goals

1. **Event-Driven Workflows**: Enable workflows to be initiated by external events
2. **Flexible Entry Points**: Support multiple trigger types (chat, email, manual, etc.)
3. **Real-Time Integration**: Allow seamless integration with external systems
4. **Simple Configuration**: Provide easy-to-configure trigger nodes

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to create trigger nodes that can initiate workflows from external events
- I want to configure trigger nodes to listen to specific trigger types
- I want trigger nodes to output structured data to connected nodes
- I want to validate that trigger nodes are only used at workflow start

### As a Workflow Designer
- I want to create workflows that respond to chat messages
- I want to create workflows that respond to email notifications
- I want to create workflows that can be manually triggered
- I want to see clear error messages when trigger configuration is invalid

## Success Criteria

1. **Trigger Interface**: Define a clear interface for trigger nodes
2. **Basic Trigger Types**: Implement chat, email, and manual trigger nodes
3. **Workflow Validation**: Ensure trigger nodes can only be used at workflow start
4. **Data Output**: Trigger nodes output structured data to connected nodes
5. **Configuration**: Support flexible configuration for different trigger types
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for trigger functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### Trigger Interface
- [ ] Define `TriggerInterface` extending `Node`
- [ ] Enforce that trigger nodes have no input requirements
- [ ] Ensure trigger nodes output structured data
- [ ] Support configuration for trigger-specific settings

### Chat Trigger Node
- [ ] Listen for chat messages
- [ ] Extract message content and metadata
- [ ] Output structured data with message information
- [ ] Support configuration for message filtering

### Email Trigger Node
- [ ] Listen for email notifications
- [ ] Extract email content, subject, and sender
- [ ] Output structured data with email information
- [ ] Support configuration for email filtering

### Manual Trigger Node
- [ ] Accept manual input/query
- [ ] Pass through input data to connected nodes
- [ ] Support configuration for input validation
- [ ] Provide clear interface for manual workflow initiation

### Workflow Validation
- [ ] Validate that trigger nodes are only at workflow start
- [ ] Prevent trigger nodes from having incoming connections
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- [ ] Support multiple trigger nodes in a single workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Trigger nodes should respond quickly to events
- Minimal overhead for trigger processing
- Efficient data passing to connected nodes

### Reliability
- Trigger nodes should handle malformed input gracefully
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Robust validation of trigger data

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new trigger types
- Consistent interface across all trigger nodes
- Support for custom trigger configurations

## Constraints

- Trigger nodes can only be used at workflow start
- Trigger nodes require no input (they are entry points)
- Trigger nodes must output structured data
- Configuration must be validated at workflow creation time

## Risks

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Event Handling**: Managing different trigger types may become complex
- **Performance Impact**: Multiple trigger nodes could impact workflow performance
- **Configuration Complexity**: Too many configuration options could confuse users

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple trigger types and expand gradually
- Implement efficient event handling patterns
- Provide sensible defaults and clear documentation
- Comprehensive testing to catch issues early

## Dependencies

- Core Node system must support trigger-specific validation
- Workflow validation system must enforce trigger placement rules
- Existing connection system must handle trigger output data
