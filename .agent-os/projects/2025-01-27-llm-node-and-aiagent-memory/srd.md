# SRD: LLM Node and AIAgent Memory Enhancement

## Feature Overview

Enhance Papi Core's AI capabilities by adding a simple LLM node for basic text generation and implementing memory/context management for AI agents to support multi-turn conversations.

## Goals

1. **Simplify AI Usage**: Provide a simpler LLM node for basic text generation tasks without tool-calling complexity
2. **Enable Conversations**: Add memory support to AI agents for maintaining conversation context
3. **Improve User Experience**: Support multi-turn interactions with context preservation
4. **Extend Use Cases**: Enable new workflow patterns requiring conversation state

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to use a simple LLM node for basic text generation tasks like summarization and translation
- I want AI agents to remember previous conversation context for better responses
- I want to build workflows that maintain conversation state across multiple interactions
- I want to configure memory retention policies for different use cases

### As an End User
- I want AI agents to remember what we discussed earlier in our conversation
- I want consistent responses that build on previous context
- I want to have natural multi-turn conversations with AI agents

## Acceptance Criteria

### LLM Node Acceptance Criteria
1. **Basic Text Generation**: LLM node can generate text responses to prompts
2. **Model Configuration**: Support for different OpenAI models with configurable parameters
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for API failures and invalid inputs
4. **Integration**: Works with existing workflow execution system
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### AIAgent Memory Acceptance Criteria
1. **Context Preservation**: AIAgent remembers conversation history across interactions
2. **Memory Management**: Configurable memory retention and cleanup policies

- Memory system should add <100ms overhead to AIAgent responses
- Memory storage should be efficient and not consume excessive resources

### Scalability
- Memory system should handle conversations with 100+ messages
- LLM node should support concurrent usage in workflows
- System should gracefully handle API rate limits

### Reliability
- Memory system should be resilient to failures
- LLM node should handle API errors gracefully
- System should maintain data integrity during failures

### Security
- Memory data should be handled securely
- API keys should be managed safely
- No sensitive data should be logged or exposed

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing AIAgent usage
- Must work within existing workflow execution framework
- Must follow established coding standards and patterns

### API Constraints
- Limited by OpenAI API rate limits and quotas
- Context window limits for different models
