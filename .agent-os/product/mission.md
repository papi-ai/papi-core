# Papi Core Mission

## What We're Building

Papi Core is a decoupled PHP library that powers an open-source, n8n-inspired AI workflow automation platform. It provides the foundational engine for building AI-powered workflows with modern, extensible PHP architecture.

## For Whom

- **PHP Developers** who want to integrate AI capabilities into their applications
- **Product Teams** building workflow automation tools
- **AI/ML Engineers** who need a flexible framework for AI agent orchestration
- **Open Source Contributors** looking to build and extend workflow automation capabilities

## Why It Matters

The current landscape of AI workflow automation is dominated by proprietary solutions or complex, framework-specific implementations. Papi Core fills this gap by providing:

- **Framework Agnostic**: Works standalone or with Laravel/Symfony
- **AI-First Design**: Built specifically for AI agent orchestration and tool-calling
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add custom tools, integrations, and nodes
- **Modern PHP**: Leverages PHP 8.1+ features for type safety and performance
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with MIT licensing

## Core Value Proposition

Papi Core transforms how developers build AI-powered applications by providing a robust, extensible foundation that handles the complexity of AI agent orchestration, tool integration, and workflow execution while remaining simple to use and extend.

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Adoption**: Number of projects using Papi Core
- **Community Growth**: Contributors, plugins, and integrations
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: Laravel/Symfony bundles, UI components
- **Performance**: Workflow execution speed and reliability
- **Extensibility**: Number of custom tools and integrations built
